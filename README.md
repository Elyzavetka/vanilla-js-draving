### Drawing Squares on HTML Canvas

This code snippet demonstrates how to draw a pattern of squares on an HTML canvas using JavaScript. It sets up a canvas context, fills a background rectangle with a light blue color, and then draws a series of squares with a darker outline. The squares are arranged in a diagonal pattern across the canvas.
